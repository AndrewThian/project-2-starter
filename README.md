# Todo-App

I tried to gamify a Todo list based losely on the web app [Habitica](https://habitica.com) which I'm really fond of. However I ran into some problems as I did not do much planning. My models and references were all over the place and I had a rough time trying to tie everything together.

## Things I would do differently  

I would plan my models before diving in as well as designing my views more adequately. Basically, follow the MVC model more closely.
1. Plan models properly
2. Develop my views and user journey through the site
3. Design my routes so that I have a proper way of accessing each ID or parameter that I require as I move through the site.

## Getting Started

git fork and clone it then install all the npm dependencies

### Prerequisites

npm install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Tests

No tests but on my next refactor I would definitely try to implement them

## Live Version

It's deployed on heroku - [here](https://turd-doo-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Built With

* express
* node.js
* mongo

## Workflow

Initially, I thought I planned my MVC rather well. However, it was my first full fledge web application and I was rather inexperienced thus ended up coding myself into a wall. I still believe my downfall was the lack of understanding in Express and Mongoose/Mongo as well inexperience in my routing.
